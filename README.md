# Coding and app-making for beginners

### Coding can open doors for you

Code is a huge part of our daily lives. It powers your phone, your bank account, your social networks... it's everywhere.

Today all businesses are moving over to digital. It's essential to have a digital presence and for us to understand how that works.

Once you know how to code, you can get ideas off the ground and communicate seamlessly with developers (and budding child prodigy programmers).

People everywhere are realising this and learning to create on the Web. Even in primary schools.

### No experience? No problem

Is `learn to code` on your list of goals this year?

It's tough sifting through the endless resources with no-one to direct all your questions.

Learning with others is fun and much easier than hacking away at online courses alone.

The course is aimed at **beginners**, so you don't need any previous experience with coding to join. We will assume _zero knowledge_ to start with, and introduce you to HTML, CSS and JavaScript whilst you design and prototype an app over 6 Saturdays.

### Start with this 6-week course

Learn to code with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the universal languages of the Web. We'll be using the browser to bring your app ideas to life.

Remember: you don't have to struggle on your own.

Having experts and classmates by your side to troubleshoot with can save you _hours_ of your life. It makes the difference between giving up at the first roadblocks, and gaining the confidence to continue learning after this course.

Join a group of determined, like-minded individuals to discuss, learn and make in a friendly environment.

### Who's teaching?

<!-- **[Matteo](https://twitter.com/@baddeo)** is a senior lecturer for [Web Media at Ravensbourne](https://twitter.com/RaveWebMedia) with loads of experience building apps and educational games. He loves teaching and has near-infinite patience. -->

<!-- **Yuki** is a self-taught JavaScript ninja and a senior developer at [The Mill](http://www.themill.com/). He has plenty of inspiring links and JS tricks to share. -->

<!-- **[Aimee](http://aimeemj.com)** makes websites and clothes. She was in your shoes a year ago, reads puzzled faces and knows when to slow down the pace. -->
**[Jonny](https://github.com/Jonnygwi)** is a JavaScript Wizz with an eye for detail. He graduated from Web Production at Ravensbourne in June 2017 and is now working as a developer for an Edtech company.

**[Harry](https://twitter.com/@h_dif)** is an ex third year [Web Media](https://twitter.com/RaveWebMedia) student with loads experience coding from various projects. Has lots of patience for debugging code.

**[Alex](https://github.com/twoofthree)** has over 5 years experience developing web applications that used across the world and is now running his own web development company in London.

### What do I need to bring?

**Laptops** are available for everyone.

If you have a laptop which you're used to, feel free to bring that along. You'll need to install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) beforehand.

We recommend bringing a **notebook and pen** for jotting down useful resources and capturing your ideas whilst they're fresh.

### Learn to design and code apps!

Working from a hands-on brief, you will write your first line of code and in a few weeks you will have made your own app.

You will experience the design and development process first-hand, and get to know the fabrics of the Web: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs.

This course is a great starting point in your app-making journey.

Suitable for people who have never written a line of code, this course will guide you through the design, prototype and development process that leads to the creation of a web-based application.

Working on hands-on briefs, you will learn the principles of programming and get familiar with the fabrics of the Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs).

# What's the plan?

Which day?	| What are we learning?
----------	| ---------------------
[![](sessions/img/day-1.jpg)](sessions/01) | On the first day we discuss key concepts around apps (interface, logic, data) and start coding with **HTML** & **CSS**.
[![](sessions/img/day-2.jpg)](sessions/02) | We introduce the principles of **programming** and start playing with **JavaScript**.
[![](sessions/img/day-3.jpg)](sessions/03) | Where to find **data** and how to use it programmatically. Your app's data has to be stored somewhere!
[![](sessions/img/day-4.jpg)](sessions/04) | Use JavaScript _libraries_ to speed up your development and learn how to troubleshoot your code, aka _debugging_.
[![](sessions/img/day-5.jpg)](sessions/05) | By this point you have a rough **app prototype**, which you can then hack to apply *your own* ideas and content.
[![](sessions/img/day-6.jpg)](sessions/06) | Tweak your app prototype. Celebrate your achievements, and take away free resources to continue your learning journey.


# Learning goals

* Appreciate how digital products work and how they are made. Understand the different uses of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.
* Get hands-on **coding practice**: follow tutors' demonstrations and integrate ready-made blocks of code in your work.
* Apply your understanding and **experiment** on your own: refine, test and *debug* your code.
* Feel confident **searching** for solutions to design challenges and coding issues.

<!--
* Identify **bugs** (unexpected behaviours in apps or code errors) using tools to *inspect* apps and come up with possible explanations.
* Create **proof-of-concept prototypes** for Web apps, which manipulate data from online databases and/or **APIs**.
* Discuss **app ideas** in terms of *interface*, *logic* and *data* with designers and developers.
* **Visualise interaction flows** with analog (paper) and digital tools.
* Break down **behaviour** (including human behaviour) into *algorithms*, that is step-by-step instructions that can be coded.  
* Understand the role of the three pillar **technologies** of the Web: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*.
* Understand how **data APIs** work (HTTP requests, API keys, URL parameters) and hook up one (or more) APIs to your Web application.
* Critically analyse the **mechanics** of a Web application, breaking down its behaviour into *data*, *functions* and *logic*.
